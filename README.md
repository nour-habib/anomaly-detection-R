# Anomaly Detection

This was a group project for Cybersecurity class. We looked at electricity consumption data and attempted 
to find anomalies using verious mathematical & statistical methods. These include min, max, standard deviation, linear
regression. We, then, narrowed down a time window of the training data in which to build our Hidden Markov Models (HMM) 
using the depmixS4 package. Then we looked at the log-likelihood value on the test data to determine which of our models
was most appropriate.
